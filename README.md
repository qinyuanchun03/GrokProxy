## Overview

This project provides a simple proxy that forwards API requests from your custom domain to the Xai API endpoint at `https://api.xai.com/v1/chat/completions`. It allows you to use Grok's API through your own domain without enforcing specific model configurations, giving you the flexibility to configure models in your local chat software.

## Quick Start

See the documentation in your preferred language for detailed instructions on deployment and usage.
